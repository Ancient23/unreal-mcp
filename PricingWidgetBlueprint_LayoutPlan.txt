Styling & Layout Notes:
-----------------------
- Background: Black or very dark color.
- Card Borders: Rounded corners, subtle border, shadow for elevation.
- Card Background: Slightly lighter than page background.
- Title: Large, bold, white/gray text.
- Subtitle: Smaller, regular, muted color.
- Toggle Buttons: Highlight selected, subtle border for unselected.
- Pricing: Large, bold, white text for price, smaller for "/month".
- Feature List: Use checkmark (✓) icon, left-aligned, monospace or code-style font for feature text.
- Buttons: White background, black text, rounded corners, padding.
- Spacing: Consistent vertical and horizontal spacing between elements and cards.
- Responsive: Cards should center and space evenly, with possible wrapping for smaller screens.

Interactivity:
--------------
- Tooltip or info icon for premium request explanations (optional).

Environment Considerations:
---------------------------
- Use only standard UMG components (TextBlock, Button, Border, etc.).
- No mock data or stubbing for dev/prod; real data binding if needed.
- Keep all logic and layout in the widget blueprint, avoid code duplication.
- If the widget grows too large (>200-300 lines), refactor into sub-widgets for each card.

Testing:
--------
- Check for visual consistency with the provided screenshot.

File Naming:
------------
- Widget Blueprint: WBP_PricingPage (suggested)
